            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                We'll first take a high level simplistic introduction to some concepts related to Sublime views.
                Related <code>api</code> details as will be referred to as little as possible. <!-- This is a useful
                grounding for when you want make your own plugins. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                Sublime is atypical in its selection paradigm so even if you are familiar with other editors it will
                pay to work through this very light read. Read it twice or thrice if need be as this background 
                knowledge will come in handy.<!--  when you go to create your own commands. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end is a
                <q>Try This</q>
                section especially for those who like to get their hands dirty when
                learning new things. 
                
                Even if you are a <q>top down</q> type just jump in and 
                get some reference for later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't get too distracted by these sections.
                 
                <strong>If anything goes over your head just move on.</strong>
                We'll eventually get around to covering the unexplained.

        <div id="buffer" class="section">
            <h2>Buffer</h2>
            <p>A buffer is a collection of <strong>characters</strong>.
            Note the emphasis on characters as opposed to bytes. A buffer is represented
            as abstract text ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">unicode</a> ) and encoded/decoded on save/load respectively.
            </p>
            <p class='concrete'>In concrete terms a buffer could be an in memory version of an already
            existing file or it could be a new unsaved file.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="view" class="section">
            <h2>View</h2>
            <p>
                Let's looks at what the
                <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/api-reference#sublime.View">the api reference</a>
                for a View has to say.
                <blockquote>
                    Represents a view into a text buffer. Note that
                    <strong>multiple views may refer to the same buffer</strong>, but
                    they have <strong>their own unique selection</strong> and geometry.
                </blockquote>
                <p class="concrete">
                    Each <q>View</q> has a concrete manifestation in Sublime as
                    a <q>tab</q> and this essentially means you can have two
                    (or more) tabs open editing the same memory buffered
                    version of a file at once. Edits you make to one are
                    reflected in the other, however each has its own set
                    of selections. In other words you could be editing the
                    top part of a buffer in one tab and the bottom in the
                    other.

            <h2>Selection</h2>
            <p>
                A selection is a <q>Region</q> of selected text (characters) in the buffer.
                In real terms think a cursor or a word you double clicked
                on.

        <div id="region" class="section">
            <p>
                <h2>Region</h2>
                Let's looks at what the
                <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/api-reference#sublime.Region">the api reference</a>
                for a Region has to say.
                <blockquote>Region(a, b).  Represents an area of the buffer. Empty regions, where a == b are valid.</blockquote>
            </p>

            <p> A region <strong>may</strong> represent a Selection but may just represent an area of a buffer. The concepts are related but not the same.</p>
            <p> <q>a</q> and <q>b</q> refer to the entry and exit points of a Region</p>

            <!-- <p>A Region has these properties:</p> -->
            <!-- <ul>
                <li>Direction</li>
                <li>Point a</li>
                <li>Point b</li>
                <li>Length</li>
                <li>Beginning</li>
                <li>Ending</li>
            </ul> -->

            <div>
                <h3>Direction</h3>
                <p>
                    If a Region is comprised of the area between two points <q>a</q> and <q>b</q> then it stands to reason
                    it must have a direction with point a being the first point of contact and point b the last.

            <div>
                <h3>Points a and b</h3>
                <p> The entry and exit points representing the bounds of a region </p>

            <div>

                    <li><code>abs(a - b)</code></li>
                    <li>
                        A Region with no length ( <code>a == b</code> ) is an <q>empty</q> region. If the region represents
                        a selection then that selection would be visualised as a <a href="#selections-and-cursors">cursor</a> <q>between</q> characters.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Beginning &amp; End points</h3>
                <p> Regions also have a <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> representing
                    <code>min(a, b)</code> and <code>max(a, b)</code>

                <ul>
                    <li>Indexing is zero based, between <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> points. </li>
                    <li>
                        With non empty regions the <code>end()</code> point is exclusive.
                        <p><code>Region(0, 2)</code> indexes points: <code>[0, 1]</code></p>
                        <p><code>Region(0, 1)</code> indexes points: <code>[0]</code></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <q>empty</q> regions such as those representing a cursor will index characters
                        as a point. The end while still exclusive is not subtractive.
                        <p><code>Region(0, 0)</code> indexes points: <code>[0]</code></p>

            <p>
                A Line (or row) is just a Region representing an area of the buffer between <q>\n</q> characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Column is a 1 based character offset from the beginning of the line.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Region may span one or more lines or even just a single column.

        </div>
        <div id="regionset" class="section">
            <h2>RegionSet</h2>
            <p>
                Let's looks at what the
                <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/api-reference#sublime.RegionSet">the api reference</a>
                for a RegionSet has to say.
                <blockquote>
                    Maintains a <strong>set</strong> of Regions, ensuring that <strong>none overlap</strong>, and that they are kept in sorted order.
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>

                The job of a RegionSet is to do all the bookkeeping of
                the selection Regions when you add/remove selections.
                Sublime is capable of multiple selections so when a
                modification is made to the buffer it must also
                adjust all effected region offsets
            </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Set Behaviour</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you are mathematical you know what this implies, but if you are more familiar with
                        python then think of a RegionSet as a special kind of <code>set()</code> for regions.

                        A set is a container that will only contain one of each unique element and it keeps them in sorted order.
                    </li>
                    <li>What makes a Region unique? That would be its area represented by its <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> points </li>
                    <li>How are Regions compared for sorting? That would be by the <code>begin()</code> point</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Non Overlapping Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    There is one big difference to typical set behaviour.

                    If you add a region to a RegionSet that already
                    contains a region its area would intersect with,
                    the two are merged. It's a very easy concept to <q>see</q>.

                    Just play around with multiple selections ( ctrl + left mouse click )
