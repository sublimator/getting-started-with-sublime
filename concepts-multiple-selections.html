                Most editors that implement multiple selections do so
                in a very limited way, bolted on to an exisiting editor
                control, implemented via special modes.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                These are generally limited to column selection and
                even when they support non-contiguous selections they
                only enable you to do very basic commands, like cut,
                paste and character entry. Once selections are made
                you can not then move the selections around as if each
                selection was a cursor.
                
            </p>
            <table class="caption">
                <tr>
                    <td><img onclick='this.src = this.src' src="images/multi-select-e.gif" /></td>
                    <td><p> Note that there is only ever one cursor at a time and once selections are made they are immovable</p></td>
                </tr>

            <h3 id="better-times-ahead">Better Times Ahead</h3>
            <p>
                
                Sublime was designed from the ground up to be fully
                capable of using multiple selections so
                <strong>EVERY</strong> command is available from
                multiple selections. Unlike most (all?) other editors
                each selection is moveable.

            </p>
            <p>
                They are not just moveable in the basic sense of
                `pressing left will move each selection one character
                to the left`, you can do commands like "Move to word
                ends" which will move each selection differing
                amounts.
            </p>
            <table class="caption">
                <tr>
                    <td><img onclick='this.src = this.src' src="images/multi-select-sublime.gif" /></td>
                    <td><p> Note the multiple cursors and ability to move each, the ability to start from the middle of the column. True multiple selection.</p></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
            
                This enables a different work-flow. Where before you'd
                make homogeneous edits via the use of regular
                expressions and macros with Sublime a lot of the time
                you can make the edit all at once which not only has a
                nice <em>controlled feel</em> to it, sometimes it is
                actually more efficient in terms of key presses.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Sublime's search facility has a <q>findAll</q> which will actually
                <em>select</em> each find instead of highlight them.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                All this to say, that Sublime acts differently and as such
                you may need to adjust your habits to get the most out of it.
                Fortunately it's very easy to do so; multiple selections can be
                quite an intuitive way of working.
                
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                We'll give some tips at how to use multiple selections
                in place of regular expressions and macros.
                
                Note that while Sublime is fully capable of macros
                including those that make use of multiple selection.

            <h2>Column Selection</h2>
            
            <p>
                There is no special <q>column selection</q> mode in
                Sublime rather it's just a label for multiple selections
                that happen to be aligned.

                    <li>Then ctrl+right to move a word at a time</li>

                        This command adds a new cursor in a direction
                        depending on how the command was paramaterised (up or down)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to understand the path-finding behaviour
                        in order to be able to consistently control the command.
                        It can otherwise be frustrating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                        If pressing ctrl+alt+up, an extra cursor will
                        be added <strong>on the same path as if you pressed up</strong>, with
                        corresponding similar behaviour when pressing
                        down.
